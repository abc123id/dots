# Hello
Wow, okay so this repo got updated and stuff but kinda just looked like garbage, so I've decided to pick it up again.
The issue is that I use windows AND linux across three computers, being my linux machine, with my gaming laptop, and my dad's PC (sometimes) for windows. So since I use both types of system, I need to operate both software types in my repo, so it's a kinda big repo.
My BSPWM dots and Qtile dots are just from archcraft, with some mods, so there isnt much. Otherwise, most stuff in there is universal.

Sincerely,
```
